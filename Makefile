#   Description
#
#	Compile a small wrapper script "eclient" that acts as a glue
#	to Native Windows Emacs emacsclient.exe. The "eclient" will
#	pass all the appropriate options to emacsclient.exe. The
#	"eclient" call is therefore all that is needed, whereas
#	"emacsclient" would have to be called with var√≠ous options.
#
#   Usage
#
#	make help
#	make ROOT="c:/path/to/emacs-23.2/bin" all install

ROOT		= C:/Program Files/emacs/bin
RUNEMACS	= $(ROOT)/runemacs.exe
EMACSCLIENTW	= $(ROOT)/emacsclientw.exe
CFLAGS		= --ansi --pedantic -Wall -g
NAME		= eclient
BIN		= $(NAME).exe

# According to the gnu-win32 faq it is possible to prevent the console
# window from showing up by adding "-Wl,-subsystem,windows"

CYGFLAGS	= -Wl,-subsystem,windows

# Rule: all - compile Cygwin wrapper to emacsclient (eclient)
all: $(BIN)

check:
	# Check that ROOT directory exists. Use "make ROOT=<directory>" to change
	[ -d "$(ROOT)" ]

		$(CYGFLAGS) \
		-DRUNEMACS='"$(RUNEMACS)"' \
		-DEMACSCLIENTW='"$(EMACSCLIENTW)"' \
		$(CFLAGS) -o $(BIN) eclient.c

# Rule: install - install to Emacs bin/ directory
